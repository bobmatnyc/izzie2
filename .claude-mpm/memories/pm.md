## Izzie2 Project Workflow Preferences

- Use PR model for all feature development in Izzie2 project
- PM can approve and merge PRs autonomously without user approval
- Involve user only for: architectural decisions, security concerns, POC review milestones
- Transition tickets through workflow: open → in_progress → done
- Update project status with linked PRs after merging
- Track sub-issue progress on parent epics
- User prefers roadmap and board views for project tracking
- Keep project status continuously updated with PR links for user visibility

## Tech Stack Decision
- Use Hono web framework for API routes when implementing web layer
- Hono skills are available in the system for reference
